Hey, This is my first ever react project which is named as textutils. this frontend application performs some simple functions on the text typed like converting to uppercase, lowercase, removing spaces etc. it has some nice features like turning the mode from like to dark and changing the about section to dark mode. 
this a simple and user friendly hope you like it
